' Actor
actor "User" as user

' Boundary Objects (UI/Interface)

boundary "Add Account\nForm" as addAccountForm
boundary "Edit Account\nForm" as editAccountForm
boundary "Confirmation\nDialog" as confirmDialog

' Entity Objects (Data)
entity "Account" as accountEntity

' Connections: Actor <-> Boundary
user --> accountListScreen : views accounts
user --> addAccountForm : adds new account
user --> editAccountForm : edits account
user --> confirmDialog : confirms delete
accountListScreen --> user : displays account list
messageDisplay --> user : shows result

' Connections: Boundary <-> Control
accountListScreen --> accountController : request accounts
addAccountForm --> validationHandler : submit new account
editAccountForm --> validationHandler : submit changes
confirmDialog --> accountController : confirm deletion
accountController --> messageDisplay : operation result
accountController --> accountListScreen : refresh list

' Connections: Control <-> Control
validationHandler --> accountController : validated data

' Connections: Control <-> Entity
accountController --> accountEntity : CRUD operations
accountController --> userEntity : verify ownership

note bottom
    **Robustness Analysis:**
    - User views/adds/edits/deletes accounts via respective screens
    - Validation Handler ensures data integrity
    - Account Controller performs CRUD on Account entity
    - User ownership verified before operations
    - Includes UC01 (Authenticate User) before access
