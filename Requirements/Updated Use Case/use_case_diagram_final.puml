' ACTOR NOTES (1 paragraph each)
'==============================================================================
note left of User
    **Primary Actor:** The User is the primary actor 
    who interacts with the system to manage personal 
    finances, set budgets, view analytics, and receive 
    notifications when budget thresholds are exceeded.
end note

note right of BankingSystem
    **Secondary Actor (External System):** The External 
    Banking System provides transaction data to the 
    application during import. It represents the outside 
    banking platform that the system communicates with 
    to retrieve financial records securely.
end note

note right of NotificationService
    **Secondary Actor (External System):** The Notification 
    Service delivers alert messages to users when budget 
    conditions are triggered. It represents external 
    messaging capabilities such as email, SMS, or push 
    notification services.

' USE CASE NOTES (1 paragraph each)
'==============================================================================
note top of UC01
    **Manage Accounts:** Allows the user to add, edit, 
    and remove financial accounts in the system. This 
    use case includes authentication to ensure only 
    authorized users can access account information.
end note

note top of UC02
    **Authenticate User:** Verifies user identity through 
    secure login credentials. This reusable use case 
    establishes a valid session and is included by 
    other use cases requiring identity verification.
end note

note top of UC03
    **Import Transactions:** Enables the user to bring 
    transaction records from the External Banking System. 
    Once imported, transactions are automatically sent 
    for categorization to organize spending data.
end note

note bottom of UC04
    **Categorize Expenses:** Assigns transactions into 
    spending categories using rules, AI classification, 
    or manual input. Proper categorization supports 
    budgeting, alerts, and dashboard analytics.
end note

note bottom of UC05
    **Set Budget Thresholds:** Allows users to define 
    spending limits for categories or overall budgets. 
    These thresholds determine when the system triggers 
    alert notifications to warn users.
end note

note bottom of UC06
    **Receive Budget Alerts:** Triggered when spending 
    crosses user-defined thresholds. The system generates 
    alerts delivered via the Notification Service to 
    inform users of budget status in real-time.
end note

note bottom of UC07
    **View Analytics Dashboard:** Displays visual charts, 
    spending breakdowns, and trends based on categorized 
    transactions. Users can analyze financial habits and 
    optionally export reports from this view.
end note

note bottom of UC08
    **Export Reports:** Generates downloadable reports 
    in formats like PDF or CSV. This optional feature 
    extends the dashboard functionality for users who 
    need offline or shareable financial summaries.
end note

note bottom of UC09
    **Manage Categorization Rules:** Enables users to 
    create and modify rules for automatic transaction 
    categorization. This extends the categorization 
    process for handling custom or unmatched cases.
end note
